2. How to View Linux System Hardware Information

Here you can use the lshw tool to gather vast information about your hardware components such as cpu, disks, memory, usb controllers etc.

lshw is a relatively small tool and there are few options that you can use with it while extracting information. The information provided by lshw gathered form different /proc files.

Note: Do remember that the lshw command executed by superuser (root) or sudo user.

8. How to Print Information about SATA Devices

You can find some information about sata devices on your system as follows using the hdparm utility. In the example below, I used the block device /dev/sda1 which the harddisk on my system.

tecmint@tecmint ~ $ sudo hdparm /dev/sda1

/dev/sda1:
 multcount     =  0 (off)
 IO_support    =  1 (32-bit)
 readonly      =  0 (off)
 readahead     = 256 (on)
 geometry      = 56065/255/63, sectors = 2048000, start = 2048

To print information about device geometry interms of cylinders, heads, sectors, size and the starting offset of the device, use the -g option.

tecmint@tecmint ~ $ sudo hdparm -g /dev/sda1

/dev/sda1:
 geometry      = 56065/255/63, sectors = 2048000, start = 2048

9. How to Print Linux File System Information

To gather information about file system partitions, you can use fdisk command. Although the main functionality of fdisk command is to modify file system partitions, it can also be used to view information about the different partitions on your file system.

You can print partition information as follows. Remember to run the command as a superuser or else you may not see any output.

tecmint@tecmint ~ $ sudo fdisk -l

WARNING: GPT (GUID Partition Table) detected on '/dev/sda'! The util fdisk doesn't support GPT. Use GNU Parted.

    Where do the html output goes to? I tried the lshw >html but I can’t find it anywhere. By the way, I was curious whether running lshw>txt would work, but it didn’t lol

        @Moltke,

        The html file created in your current working directory, for example if you run the following command from /home/username, the output of html will be created under /home/username, that you can check with ls command.

        # sudo lshw -html > lshw.html
        # ls

            Thank you for your answer. Yes, after posting the question it occurred to me to check the capture again and there it was; /home/username on the search bar, so I went to my home folder and found it.

            Felt a little bit like a fool and wanted to delete the comment but it is not possible to do so :)…thanks again for your answer. And nice article! I’m a big fan of this site, always come to check what’s new and always find some really useful articles like this one.

            By the way, if I were to do some “benchmarks” on Linux systems, what is the best way to do so? Something else than top, htop or the likes.

            I’m running some VMs under virtualbox and I’m curious if it is possible to do and how. I’d like to do that to compare them all cause I’m creating a wiki with all the tests I’ve done so far for personal use and who knows, maybe even upload it onto the web!!

                You can use:
                1. glances – a top-like monitoring tool with modern features compared to top
                2. smem – reports memory consumption per-process and per-user basis in Linux
                3. stress-ng – impose high CPU load and run stress test
                4. And there are lot’s of other tools you can find here: 20 Command Line Tools to Monitor Linux Performance

                These are obviously not the only tools, but i believe using a collection of various tools/utilities can help you come up with accurate and more reliable results. Thanks.

                    Thanks for your answer. I’ve used glances and it is quite useful. The other ones haven’t used them yet, but I will.

                    On Linux system where systemd is present, it’s possible to use some command line utilities to gather information about boot time, CPU usage and more, what can I use to do this in those ones where it is not?.

                    Also, the mesa-utils offer the capability to run tests on graphics performance. However, this is a lot of information to process and it is much time consuming, is there such a software/tool which I can use for gathering this information altogether?

                    I think probably not, but if you don’t mind I’d like to post the question, is there any? In the link you provided I see collectl, and it certainly looks like the perfect tool to accomplish what I want, or at least most of it, so I’ll try it and see what’s capable of. Thanks again for taking the time to answer. :)

    You can also use smartctl to check your drives, hpasmcli/hpacucli for hp servers, and ipmitool sdr list to see information about your sensors, fans, etc.

        I suppose you mean checking PC hardware info from a Linux machine, we have not come across any specific tools for that purpose, however, you can use network monitoring tools such as Nagios, Zabbix, Monitorix and many more. Although, they may not offer detailed hardware info from PCs.

        You could use “ansible” which is great tool mainly used for automation, orchestration, which can also handy for running standalone commands, which can just use native ssh protocol to query end device and pull out complete hardware dump and show it.

        This is again open source, however, there is an enterprise version called “ansible tower” for which u would need license. Ansible is belongs to Red Hat now.

            Thanks for the clear, descriptive and above all useful feedback. I’ll surely try it out and hope every user who has faced the same issue as @Kerhap Gause will as well.
